/*var declares a variable.
let declares a variable that is block-scoped (more on this later).
const declares a block-scoped variable, that is a constant.

Variables
A variable is a container of memory that holds a value. Declaring a variable is as simple as writing var myVariable;. A variable can be declared in this way, but does not have a value until it is initialized by assigning it one: myVariable = 0;. In JavaScript we can declare a variable and initialize it at the same time: var myVariable = 0;. It can contain virtually anything, but it has certain naming conventions that must be followed:
A variable MUST begin with a letter a-z, an underscore _ , or a dollar sign $ .
Numbers 0-9 may follow any of these characters h3ll0.
JavaScript is a case-sensitive language: HELLO and HeLLo are two different variables.

Declaring Variables
There are three ways to declare a variable in JavaScript:
The var keyword:  var newVariable;
Assign a variable a value: newVariable = 12
The let or const keywords: let newVariable = 12; const newVariable = 12
